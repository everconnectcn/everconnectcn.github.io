While it does no harm contribuating one's whole life to one oganization, I do think that a change of crearee from now and then will do much help develeping a well-rounded perfesional skill set for a person.On the one hand, there are many examples that somebody stick to the same company and have a successful career. By doing so, they can avoid the hassle of switching career path, getting to know each other with colleges. They do not have to start from scratch but focus themselves on what is important. They already know how things work in the company, so it is easy to collabrate with each other and it is a win-win situation for both individuals and employers.On the other hand, having the right to change one's company or even career path do give more oppotunities to employees. When companies get big,they tend to have their own problem, for example, the communication get comlicated, it involves too many regulations to release new products, many employees are slicking around rather than doing real work. For the employees, it is better for them to change company and do the  work that they really engoy. Also they can learn new knowledge and  it brings new blood and enery to the organization.To summurize, I do think it is important for employees to have the career that they truely enjoy, rather than stick to the same company. By doing so, they can learn new knowledge and the organization avoid geting staganated. It is a win-win situation for both.

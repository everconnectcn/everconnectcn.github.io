# Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted to do something, yet failed to really do it, if you know what I mean. Writing a blog, starting a Youtube channel with a million followers, get my licence done and start a ADV adventure, they all seems fascinating to me, it's just I have a lot of ideas, but fails to execute them. Yesterday I saw a video posted by the Techlead, a very practical guy with a sense of humor. What struck me was the execution part, yes, lots of people have lots of ideas, yet few really have done something to realize it.

What I lack is just the attitude to just do it, right here, right now. So here I am writing, better late than never.

What will this blog be about? 

From time to time, I ask myself, I believe everyone does so, what is my life for? It's really a big question, and everyone has his own answer. To me, sure I do want to summerise it to one piece of paper, but here I just want to put it really practical, which is "A Million Possiblities". Life is to enjoy, sure, but how? We need a whole bunch of money, a lot of time, someone to spent together with, something to working for, somewhere to explore. I don't want to boast, nor do I have the position to do it. What I see is this is a start, a lifestyle, a place where I can get inspired, a place I can remind myself that I should keep on learning, even a place I can regret about what I've done and try not blow up again, a place I can talk to myself, as well as you, my dear readers, to share, to explore, to contribuate myself to something, if it have the chance to help you with anything, it will be my biggest pleasure. There are so many thoughts right now, that I can't even write them all outï¼Œbut I'll try my best.

About comsumer and producer
I have been a comsumer for way too many years, trying to stay at the comfort zone, but I haven't grow so much. Watching others talking on Youtube doesn't mean that I can talk as confidently as them, searching and studying about all kind of specs about motorcycles doesn't mean that I can hop  on one and hit the road, doing a lot of research about companies doesn't mean that I can found my own start-up easily like a breeze. I have been too much of a comsumer, now it's time to share something, also create my own narrative, but mainly about shareing and discussing. Only by making an approach, can one really be held accountable, be noticed by others, be useful to others.

About China and Chinese people
I have so much complaint about China and Chinese people, but here and now, I find that it just about me, about me not doing the right thing, not making the right choice, not taking the initiative, not sharing with others but always thinking about taking rather than giving. It's time to change, try to make myself accountable, stop complain about things and see the positive side of things, try to really build up my life path, try to help others and make positive connections.

About dream, if she can do it, why can't I ?

I watched a Tedx talk about a programer called Ling Sun, who take ten years from a factury girl to a contract programmer at Google in New York. I pumped up so much adrenaline that I can't take a nap. The thing is, if she can do it, why can't I? What is stopping me from achieving my dream? Laziness? Not committed enough? A lot. Now what I will do? Try to optimize my time, try to be more committed to my cause, try to give a chance, there are a million reasons that I should do this, the only thing is, how committed am I ? Just dedicate myself to it, just give me a chance, try to say it aloud to myself every day, a million times.

About IELTS

Now that the only thing that barricade me from my dream is an IELTS score, to be specific, a score for speaking and writing, and I see this blog as a place where I can practice doing this. I'll put up different topics, and my ideas and thoughts on it, you konw, it's only when you write it down with your own hands and speak it out with your own mouth, it is your idea. There are different expressions about this saying, but it's the same meaning. What it emphisis is, to produce, to think, to consider, to write, to contemplate, rather than to purely consume. I will try to figure out whether I can use mp3 file here, I will put up my speakings here as well.

About myself and the universe
Once I got started, there are just too many things that I wanna say, but now, I just stop here. Thanks to git, I can edit my manifestation whenever I want, so let's begin our journey.

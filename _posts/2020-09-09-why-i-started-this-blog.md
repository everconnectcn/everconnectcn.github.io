# Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted to do something, yet failed to really do it, if you know what I mean. Writing a blog, starting a Youtube channel with a million followers, get my licence done and start a ADV adventure, they all seems fascinating to me, it's just I have a lot of ideas, but fails to execute them. Yesterday I saw a video posted by the Techlead, a very practical guy with a sense of humor. What struck me was the execution part, yes, lots of people have lots of ideas, yet few really have done something to realize it.

What I lack is just the attitude to just do it, right here, right now. So here I am writing, better late than never.

What will this blog be about? 

From time to time, I ask myself, I believe everyone does so, what is my life for? It's really a big question, and everyone has his own answer. To me, sure I do want to summerise it to one piece of paper, but here I just want to put it really practical, which is "A Million Possiblities". Life is to enjoy, sure, but how? We need a whole bunch of money, a lot of time, someone to spent together with, something to working for, somewhere to explore.

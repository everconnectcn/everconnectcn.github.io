## About Social Network

1. What do you think about social network?

This is really a tough question. I can't simply say it's good or bad for us, cause it's like a double-edged sword, and it's more compolicated than that, cause it has way more impact on every aspect of our life, our mental health and even our physical health. It's so prevalent today that nearly every yong people have at least one sns account, even my mom, who is in her sixties, has one, and she is addicted to it.

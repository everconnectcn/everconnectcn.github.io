While some museums are government-funded, there do exist some that charge people to get inside. While there are plenty of reasons for museums to be free, I do think that a museum that charges an entrance fee will be better/reasonable. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of museums charging an entrance fee.
Charging for an admission surely will make a museum self-funded, at least alleviate the financial situation of the government. There are plenty of benefits to it. First, it does not rely on taxpayers' money, while is beneficial for everybody. Furthermore, the staff working for the museum can get paid better thanks to the extra funding, also facilities in the museum can get well maintained, making it a nicer place for visitors. Last but not least, if it can be profitable, there might be more private museums.
On the other side, an admission charge can also have disadvantages. When a museum is free, it can give easier access to a majority of people, but when it charges, people will hesitate to go in. Also, children make a major portation of the visitors, a charging museum means no more free access to a world of knowledge, a place where they can get inspired and their curiosity can be fulfilled. Moreover, a lot of museums are where people go in to remember history and pay their respect to the former generations and founding fathers, if they charge, then people will lose an opportunity to have easy access to do so.
In summary, I think the benefits of museums charging for an entrance fee outweigh the downside. Only the visitors, not the government funding pay for the visit is more fair. Also with extra money, they can be well maintained.  Only when people pay some fee, they will cherish the exhibitions that they see.

Some museums have an admission charge while some do not. In my opinion, the drawbacks of an entrance fee are eclipsed by its benefits in the sense that the income will be ploughed back into operation and development of the museums.

A major disadvantage of an admission fee is the possibility of reducing the number of visitors. Museums house exhibitions and artefacts of great educational and historical value. If the chief aim of a museum is to introduce the local community, admission should be free to the public and visitors. Take some folk museums in Hong Kong, which preserve historic relics and display folk customs, for example. Admission to these folk museums, which are often monuments, is free of charge. If they had charged an entrance fee, many might have turned to other activities.

Granted, an entrance fee might have a negative effect on the admission figures, but an income is favorable to museums in terms of operation. Museums feature educational exhibitions at times, and this could not have been done without a sum of money expended on hiring professionals and buying equipment. The Hong Kong Space Museum, for instance, has monthly exhibitions on different issues and professional docents are employed to take visitors on a guided tour around the museum. This example speaks volumes about how a reasonable admission charge is advantageous to the operation of a museum.

In conclusion, the disadvantages of an admission fee are overshadowed by the benefits accruing from a stable source of income. Therefore, having weighed up the pros and cons, I am convinced that museums should charge an entrance fee for the sake of operation and development.


Lots of museums charge a fee while others do not. This essay thinks that the benefits of charging do not outweigh the drawbacks because open access to relics and art is more important than generating money that the government should supply in any event.

The main disadvantage is that high fees exclude a large proportion of the population, especially in less developed countries. Many people in poorer countries have just enough money for food and shelter. Exhibits are one of the few cultural activities they can enjoy free of charge. For example, Egypt has millions of people living in poverty, but also a rich and ancient culture and it is therefore important that everyone gets to experience these artefacts. Another big negative is that students and children who are learning about the world may not be able to visit. It would be a huge shame if art students could not see their favourite painters or sculptor’s work in real life because their finances could not cover the cost.

Despite this, there are some who say that museums are unsustainable without the money they might get from ticket sales. They say that this allows the building to remain open and it is better that some people get to experience it, rather than none at all. To this I would say that the government should step in and cover the cost because culture is as important as anything else it spends money on. For instance, in the UK there have been huge government spending cuts over the last few years, but the museums have not had their funding reduced because of their importance to the country’s cultural heritage.

In conclusion, although some might say that places of culture should be run like a business, the cost to the education and heritage of the country is too great and they should remain free to all.

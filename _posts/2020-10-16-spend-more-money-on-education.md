There is a debate of whether the government should set aside more budget on education than recreational and sporty activities. I abselutely agree that governments should do so. Here in this essay, I will discuss the reason why  governments should spending more money on education.
Education is such an siganificat secton of our daily life as well as a country's future. Study shows that education might cost much in the first place, but it has a great value on boosting a country's economy. Generations would become more knowledgable and creative through a decent education. In the future, they would become the main driving force of a country's comsumer base and work force. Futhermore, a man received proper education would likely to be more cerative and productive, and a generation of creative people, will change the economic output fundmantlely.

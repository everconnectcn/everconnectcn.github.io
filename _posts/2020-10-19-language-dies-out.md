I do not agree with the oponion.
language is not simple, with some language we can express things that do not belong to another language. it is an art not only a form of tool to communicate.
yes people can communicate with each other with common language like english, but the minor language should be preserved.for example, they can be of great value when it come to a speciafic secuation, for example, US military force use some language to encript their communication, so that the message would not be compromised by the axis enemies.


It is argeud that the annual extinction of many languages is not a problem because fewer languages lead to a more convinent life. It is disagreed that the convenience of using just a few key languages makes the dying out of less spoken dialects acceptable. This essay will first discuss the importance of language to culture and second the fact that learning a few common language is unrealistic, followed by a reasoned conclusion.

A language is not just a group of spoken words but the key to somenone's culture.  Language has evolved over thousands of years to reflect what is means to be from a particular place. For example, the Irish language has one of the widest vocabularies in the world and reflects their tradition of storytelling. Despite this, English has become the first language of the Irish, as many feel that it makes it easier to communicate with the rest of the world.

By speaking just a couple of languages, such as English and Chinese, you alienate billions of people throughout the world. English may be common ,but it is not the 'lingua franca ' many people think it is and it would take generations for everyone to learn it. Countries like Korea and Vietnam have been trying to adopt English as a second language for a long time, but most of their people still can't fully grasp it. However, English has been the language of business for a long time it it should be encouraged to help a country become more economically competitive.

To conclude, commonly spoken languages may make life more straightforword, but this should not be at the expense of less prevalent lanuages, in order to avoid the erosion of culture and the alienatoin of many countries.

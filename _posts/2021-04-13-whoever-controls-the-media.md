Someone says that the people in charge of the media also control people's mind, and we can do little to change this situation. Although this sound quite controversal at first sound, I agree with this idea.


First, people are highly dependent on media nowadays to the extend that they almost reley on media solely to aquire news and oponions. Online media are so accessible so that people can stay up to date with everything happening in the world in realtime. The downside of this phenomenon is people also consume the stance and attituate of the news writer, regardless of the true nature of the event and its effect. For example, during the cold war, United States and Soviet Union both use its mass media such as newspaper and televison as their political propaganda tool to condemn the other side, resulting a large proportion of people having a negtive option towards the other country.


As of whether we can do something about the situation, I do not think that we can really change it. Because most of the media is controled by big conglomerates or tycoons, under the current legal framework it is their freedom to express their idea, we can not just change the opinion of them. Even if we can set up our own websites and have our own newspapers in circulation, it is highly unlikely that we could have our readers without a huge financial backup.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that whoever controls the media also controls people's attituate and opinion,
also we can do little about it.

In some countries, the media is exclusively controlled by some large companies; in others it is the government that has this control. Often, in a war situation, one of the first carluties is the media, which is seized by one group or another. This gives some support that the media is a source of power and control.


Whoever controls the media has also ultimate control of what is broadcasted and what is omitted. They can also add some bias and prejudice to the covetage of news stories according to their own feelings about the matter. This is not a new problem, although the issue is perhaps more pressing now that the Internet and pay-TV have enabled these messages to be disseminated even further.

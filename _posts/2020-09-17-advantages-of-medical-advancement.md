Following the advancement of medical care, people's life excectancy is increasing noticably. While this seems perfict at first glance, it might as well bring some problems we have to deal with. This essay will discuss both adcantages and disadvantages and give my own opinion.

For long people have suffered from all kinds of disease or injuries, our medical advancement always takes care of the vurrable people and also increase life expectancy greatly. This is great because with a longer life, people can do a lot more things. For example, with the inovation of pannisilin, soldier don't have to die because of induries and can continue fight for our country. With a longer life expectancy, people no longer have to fear about going for advantures and can explore the planet more.

But on the other hand, this can also be a berdon to our society and our country. For instance, elderly people have to be taken care of, which put a great berdon to both the finitial situation of the country and also to the health care workers. elder people tend to have more complicatons due to the nature of body, thus they tend to take a greater perpotion of the health care resources and they can not contribute to our society as much.

In my opinion, though more elderly people bring the the society more berdon to take care, the adcancement of health care outweigh the disadvantages, they have more life experience and field expertize, and they can do a better job contributing our society and teach the younger generation.
